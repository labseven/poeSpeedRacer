# How to be fast

# Thoughts on The Lab Handout:

## BOM:
2 IR sensors
* Orientation:
Next to each other
Using 'grey' zone to get quicker feedback on steering, with second ir sensor for fallback
One ir sensor as encoder
Both IR sensors as encoders

Build encoders using handmade switches on the axes to dead reckon more effectively.
